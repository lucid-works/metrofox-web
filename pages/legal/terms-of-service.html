        security, or technical issues; or (c) permitted in order to protect Metrofox, other Users, or the public. If

        personally identifiable information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

                and
                Customer for subscriptions to the Metrofox Services and Platform. By agreeing to these Terms, Customer
                acknowledges that it and its Authorized Affiliates qualify as the "Controller" as defined under General
                Data
                Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council ("GDPR") to the extent
                that Metrofox processes Personal Data in connection with Customer’s subscription to Platform. All

                of

            <h5>2. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>
            <p><span>2.1 Roles of the parties.</span> The parties acknowledge and agree that
                with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, Customer is the Controller, Metrofox is the Processor
                and that Metrofox or members of the Metrofox Group will engage Sub-processors pursuant to the
                requirements set forth in Section 5 "Sub-processors" below.</p>
            <p><span>2.2 Customer’s processing of personal data.</span> Customer shall, in its
                use of the Services, Process Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws
                and Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer’s instructions for the Processing of Personal Data
                shall comply with Data Protection Laws and Regulations. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the
                accuracy, quality, and legality of Personal Data and the means by which Customer acquired Personal Data.
            </p>
            <p><span>2.3 Metrofox’s processing of personal data.</span> Metrofox shall treat
                Personal Data as Confidential Information and shall only Process Personal Data on behalf of and in
                accordance with Customer’s documented instructions for the following purposes: (i) Processing in
                accordance with the Terms and applicable order form(s); (ii) Processing initiated by Users in their use
                of the Services; and (iii) Processing to comply with other documented reasonable instructions provided
                by Customer (e.g., via email) where such instructions are consistent with the terms of the Agreement.
            </p>
            <p><span>2.4 Details of the processing.</span> The subject-matter of Processing of
                Personal Data by Metrofox is the performance of the Services pursuant to the Terms. The duration of the
                Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, the types of Personal Data and categories of Data
                Subjects Processed under this PDPA are further specified above.</p>

            <h5>3. RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS</h5>
            <p><span>3.1 Data subject request.</span> Metrofox shall, to the extent legally
                permitted, promptly notify Customer if Metrofox receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise the
                Data Subject's right of access, right to rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure ("right to be
                forgotten"), data portability, object to the Processing, or its right not to be subject to an automated
                individual decision making ("Data Subject Request"). Taking into account the nature of the Processing,
                Metrofox shall assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is
                possible, for the fulfilment of Customer’s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request under Data
                Protection Laws and Regulations. In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does
                not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, Metrofox shall upon Customer’s request provide
                commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the
                extent Metrofox is legally permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required
                under Data Protection Laws and Regulations. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be
                responsible for any costs arising from Metrofox’s provision of such assistance.</p>

            <h5>4. Metrofox PERSONNEL</h5>
            <p><span>4.1 Confidentiality.</span> Metrofox shall ensure that its personnel
                engaged in the Processing of Personal Data are informed of the confidential nature of the Personal Data,
                have received appropriate training on their responsibilities and have executed written confidentiality
                agreements. Metrofox shall ensure that such confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the
                personnel engagement.</p>
            <p><span>4.2 Reliability.</span> Metrofox shall take commercially reasonable steps
                to ensure the reliability of any Metrofox personnel engaged in the Processing of Personal Data.</p>
            <p><span>4.3 Limitation of access.</span> Metrofox shall ensure that Metrofox’s
                access to Personal Data is limited to those personnel performing Services in accordance with the
                Agreement.</p>
            <p><span>4.4 Data protection officer.</span> Members of the Metrofox Group have
                appointed a data protection officer. The appointed person may be reached at <a
                        href="mailto:jared@Metrofox.com">jared@Metrofox.com</a>.</p>

            <h5>5. SUB-PROCESSORS</h5>
            <p><span>5.1 Appointment of sub-processors.</span> Customer acknowledges and
                agrees that (a) Metrofox’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) Metrofox and Metrofox’s
                Affiliates respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the
                Services. Metrofox or a Metrofox Affiliate has entered into a written agreement with each Sub-processor
                containing data protection obligations not less protective than those in these Terms with respect to the
                protection of Customer Data to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such
                Sub-processor.</p>
            <p><span>5.2 List of current sub-processors and notification of new sub-processors.</span>
                Metrofox shall make available to Customer the current list of Sub-processors for the Services. Such
                Sub-processor lists shall include the identities of those Sub-processors and their country of location.
                Metrofox shall provide notification of a new Sub-processor(s) before authorizing any new
                Sub-processor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.
            </p>
            <p><span>5.3 Objection right for new sub-processors.</span> Customer may object to
                Metrofox’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying Metrofox promptly in writing within ten (10) business
                days after receipt of Metrofox’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set out in Section 5.2. In the
                event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, Metrofox will use
                reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially
                reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal
                Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening the Customer. If Metrofox is
                unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty
                (30) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Services with respect only to those Services which
                cannot be provided by Metrofox without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written
                notice to Metrofox. Metrofox will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of
                such Services following the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services,
                without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.</p>
            <p><span>5.4 Liability.</span> Metrofox shall be liable for the acts and omissions
                of its Sub-processors to the same extent Metrofox would be liable if performing the services of each
                Sub-processor directly under the terms of this PDPA, except as otherwise set forth in the Terms.</p>

            <h5>6. SECURITY</h5>
            <p><span>6.1 Controls for the protection of customer data.</span> Metrofox shall
                maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures for protection of the security (including
                protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction,
                loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data), confidentiality
                and integrity of Customer Data, as set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation.
                Metrofox regularly monitors compliance with these measures. Metrofox will not materially decrease the
                overall security of the Services during a subscription term.</p>
            <p><span>6.2 Third-party certifications and audits.</span> Metrofox has obtained
                the third-party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture
                Documentation. Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to the
                confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Metrofox shall make available to Customer that
                is not a competitor of Metrofox (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor that is not a competitor
                of Metrofox) a copy of Metrofox’s then most recent third-party audits or certifications, as applicable.
            </p>

            <h5>7. CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION</h5>
            <p>Metrofox maintains security incident management policies and procedures specified in the Security,
                Privacy and Architecture Documentation and shall, notify Customer without undue delay after becoming
                aware of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access
                to Customer Data, including Personal Data, transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed by Metrofox or its
                Sub-processors of which Metrofox becomes aware (a "Customer Data Incident"). Metrofox shall make
                reasonable efforts to identify the cause of such Customer Data Incident and take those steps as Metrofox
                deems necessary and reasonable in order to remediate the cause of such a Customer Data Incident to the
                extent the remediation is within Metrofox’s reasonable control. The obligations herein shall not apply
                to incidents that are caused by Customer or Customer’s Users.</p>

            <h5>8. RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA</h5>
            <p>Metrofox shall return Customer Data to Customer and, to the extent allowed by applicable law, delete
                Customer Data in accordance with the procedures and timeframes specified in the Security and Privacy
                Documentation.</p>

            <h5>9. AUTHORIZED AFFILIATES</h5>
            <p><span>9.1 Contractual relationship.</span> The parties acknowledge and agree
                that, by executing the Terms, the Customer enters into the PDPA on behalf of itself and, as applicable,
                in the name and on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates, thereby establishing a separate PDPA between
                Metrofox and each such Authorized Affiliate subject to the provisions of the Agreement and this Section
                9 and Section 10. Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this PDPA and,
                to the extent applicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and
                does not become a party to the Terms, and is only a party to the PDPA. All access to and use of the
                Services and Content by Authorized Affiliates must comply with the Terms and any violation of the Terms
                by an Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.</p>
            <p><span>9.2 Communication.</span> The Customer that is the contracting party to
                Terms shall remain responsible for coordinating all communication with Metrofox under this PDPA and be
                entitled to make and receive any communication in relation to this PDPA on behalf of its Authorized
                Affiliates.</p>
            <p><span>9.3 Rights of authorized affiliates.</span> Where an Authorized Affiliate
                becomes a party to the PDPA with Metrofox, it shall to the extent required under applicable Data
                Protection Laws and Regulations be entitled to exercise the rights and seek remedies under this PDPA,
                subject to the following:</p>
            <p><span>9.3.1</span> Except where applicable Data Protection Laws and
                Regulations require the Authorized Affiliate to exercise a right or seek any remedy under this PDPA
                against Metrofox directly by itself, the parties agree that (i) solely the Customer that is the
                contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of
                the Authorized Affiliate, and (ii) the Customer that is the contracting party to the Terms shall
                exercise any such rights under this PDPA not separately for each Authorized Affiliate individually but
                in a combined manner for all of its Authorized Affiliates together (as set forth, for example, in
                Section 9.3.2, below).</p>
            <p><span>9.3.2</span> The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting
                party to the Terms and shall, when carrying out an onsite audit of the procedures relevant to the
                protection of Personal Data, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on Metrofox and its
                Sub-Processors by combining, to the extent reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on
                behalf of different Authorized Affiliates in one single audit.</p>

            <h5>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
            <p>Each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or
                related to this PDPA, and all PDPAs between Authorized Affiliates and Metrofox, whether in contract,
                tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of
                Terms, and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means the aggregate liability of
                that party and all of its Affiliates under the Terms and all PDPAs together. For the avoidance of doubt,
                Metrofox's and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from the Customer and all of its
                Authorized Affiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and each PDPA shall apply in the
                aggregate for all claims under both the Agreement and all PDPAs established under this Agreement,
                including by Customer and all Authorized Affiliates, and, in particular, shall not be understood to
                apply individually and severally to Customer and/or to any Authorized Affiliate that is a contractual
                party to any such PDPA.</p>

            <h5>11. EUROPEAN SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</h5>
            <p><span>11.1 GDPR.</span> With effect from 25 May 2018, Metrofox will Process
